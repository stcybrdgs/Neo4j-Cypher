-- working with Northwind in Neo4j

/*

	The Northwind Graph demonstrates how to migrate from a relational database to Neo4j. The transformation is iterative and deliberate, emphasizing the conceptual shift from relational tables to the nodes and relationships of a graph.

	This guide will show you how to:

	Load: create data from external CSV files
	Index: index nodes based on label
	Relate: transform foreign key references into data relationships
	Promote: transform join records into relationships
