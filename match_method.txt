----------------
# first, in python import graph database from neo4j driver

	from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# next, instantiate the driver object with GraphDatabse.driver and
# specify the network location for the neo4j instance
# if you are using localhost, you will be running over the bolt protocol
# bolt is the binary protocol that allows sending compressed, encrypted data
# over the wire efficiently for reading/wrting to/from Neo4j
# also specify the username and password
# for now, you can setup

	driver = GraphDatabase.driver('bolt://localhost:7687', auth=('neo4j', 'devpass'))

# you'll keep driver around throughout the program, but anytime you want to connect to neo4j,
# you will create a new session object.

# here is a basic query executed against neo4j using a python driver:
with driver.session() as session:
result = session.run('MATCH (n) RETURN COUNT(n) AS num')
